\begin{lemma}[base case]
  \label{base-case}
  If the polynomial 
  \[
  f(x)=a_nx^n+\dots+a_0
  \]
  has a sign change from $a_n$ to $a_0$, then it has a positive real root.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We can rewrite $f(x)=x p(x)-q(x)$ where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials with nonnegative coefficients. Then
  \[
  f(0)=-q(0) < 0
  \]
  and 
  \[
  \lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)= xp(x)-q(x)=\infty >0  
  \]
  hence $f(x)$ must have a real root. 
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Descartes's rule of signs]
  Consider
  \[
  f(x)=a_nx^n+\dots+a_0
  \]
  Let $C$ be the number of sign changes from $a_n$ to $a_0$. There are at most $C$ positive roots of $f$, and if there are fewer, there must be $C-2n$ positive roots. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By \nameref{base-case}, we know a polynomial with no sign changes has no positive roots. 
  
\end{proof}
